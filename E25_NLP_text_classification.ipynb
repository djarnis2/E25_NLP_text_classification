            "I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals from all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography--there's even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants.<br /><br />Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is distinct from Taylor's. The only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.<br /><br />If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk\n"

            "Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as \"Teachers\". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched.

            "Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently \"I'm a lawyer\" he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often) \n",

            "Original sentence: this is an extremely dense somber and complicated film that unravels quite slowly revealing excruciating detail like the attention paid in a novel and watching this film is like watching a novel unfold while i didn't care for the narrator as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen and the lead summer phoenix is fabulous her innocence and naivete some might find implausible sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland i can buy that critique but she's still fabulous partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before this film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by eric gautier and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect it's always surprising and despite it's length the film never reveals more than it needs to at 163 minutes it's extremely concise to a fault i'd say which is one of the wonders of this film it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best you're likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience the family moments are unique ian holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since cassavetes' opening night or perhaps chaplin's limelight but believe it or not this film is much less conventional i never knew where this film was going and now having seen it it still has multiple possibilities this is a powerful incredibly provocative film\n",

            "Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut the Gothic-horror Frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 US Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as The Greatest Game Ever Played I'm no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with Miracle and Cinderella Man but some how this film was enthralling all the same The film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's Carnivale and Rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour Once the action moves to the US Open things pick up very well Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure Golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it Despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience\n",
